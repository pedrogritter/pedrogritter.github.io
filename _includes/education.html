                      <p>
                        In 2013, I decided to take a leap into one of my long-standing passions: movies and cinema. I enrolled in an Audiovisuals and Multimedia course at Restart School, and it was a year that profoundly enriched my understanding and appreciation of the cinematic arts.

                      <p>
                        During this course, I immersed myself in the fascinating world of Cinema and TV theory. I learned about camera angles, script writing, and the symbolic techniques used to convey deeper meanings in film. This theoretical foundation helped me understand the intricate details that go into crafting compelling visual stories.

                      <p>
                        The course also provided hands-on experience in video post-production. I learned various editing techniques, color correction methods, and how to manage raw data effectively. These skills have been invaluable, allowing me to enhance the quality of the content I capture during my adventures. Whether it's a scenic motorcycle ride or a serene freediving session, I can now edit and polish these moments into visually appealing narratives.

                        Additionally, I delved into the production and direction of film. I became proficient in operating video cameras and microphones, setting up multi-camera shoots, and creating the right studio settings with proper lighting. This practical knowledge was incredibly engaging and gave me a newfound respect for the technical expertise behind filmmaking.

                      <p>
                        Even though I didn't pursue a career in this field, the experience was immensely enjoyable and rewarding. It deepened my love for cinema and provided me with a creative outlet that I continue to explore. Today, I apply these skills to my personal projects, capturing and editing the footage from my travels and hobbies, and sharing these adventures with a polished, cinematic touch.

                        Studying at Restart School was a journey of discovery and creativity. It allowed me to explore a passion of mine thoroughly and equipped me with skills that I cherish and use regularly. This year was not just about learning but also about having fun and indulging in something I am genuinely passionate about.
